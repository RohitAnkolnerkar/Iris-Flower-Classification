# Iris flower classification

In this task, I took Iris Flower dataset and performed Logistic Regression Algorithm to make model.

It finally categorized flowers into species.

I got an accuracy of 97.37% and It demonstrates that the model I created is extremely accurate.

And I predicted the Species using a fresh set of data and obtained an accurate result.
